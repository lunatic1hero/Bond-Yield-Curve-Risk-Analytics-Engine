# Bond-Yield-Curve-Risk-Analytics-Engine


## 💹 Overview
This project models and analyzes **yield curves** and **interest rate risk** across fixed-income markets.  
It helps understand how yield curves move, computes bond risk metrics (duration, convexity), and simulates portfolio risk exposure.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Fetch and clean yield curve data from reliable sources.
- Fit yield curve models (Nelson-Siegel / Svensson).
- Compute duration, convexity, and Value-at-Risk (VaR).
- Visualize yield curve movements and risk metrics.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Yield curve construction and fitting.  
- Duration and convexity analytics for individual bonds or portfolios.  
- Scenario analysis for parallel/steepening/flattening shifts.  
- Visualization of yield curve dynamics over time.
